    "- One of the popular sports in the U.S. is basketball. One of the most important days in any sport is game day. Prathusha did an internship with the basketball team and this idea fascinated the others. Because of the interest in basketball and the importance of game day, we are trying to predict the performance on game day based on various factors taken into consideration for our home team.\n",

    "- Prediction of the performance of individual players as game day arrives is based on various deciding factors like injury, player involvement, and other measures of performance for each practice. Game day is quite stressful, but also an important day to perform well. Without adding more pressure on the team to perform well on game day, our analytics will help the home team to win the match based on their performance on each day.\n",
    "- We will use the factors injury, duration of each player’s practice, and the performance of each of the players as game day approaches, to do supervised and unsupervised analysis. Various factors will be used in these analyses to get maximum achieved performance on game day.\n",
    "- Implementing strategic analysis methods will increase the probability of the team winning games in the future as well as reduce injuries.\n"
